I have to say this Sinatra application project definitely felt like finding my way through a maze at times. The entire Sinatra module really opened my eyes to how applications are actually built, there was a lot of frustration at times but also an incredible amount of excitement once you start to see things come together and become an actual functioning application. Some major things I learned while working on it were that you really have to check absolutely every step once you write a new line of code or create a new route. Check every new route immediately to see that you are going where you think you are going. 

The MVC setup itself isn't that daunting, you can essentially put together the skeleton of your application entirely after you've created your models, view files, controller(s), and made your database migrations. Once that's done you are just making sure every route is taking you where you need to go within youre controller(s) (which I found to be the hard part) and then go back and make some minor changes/add logic. My project ended up being late because I was doing a lot of coding and not much checking and eventually it became messy and I needed to look through everything and check routes and when I would make a change I would end up with a new error. Now I know for the future to never approach it in that way but to check every step, go into tux and make sure data is being stored, make sure my associations are as expected or see that my password is being hashed by the bcyrpt gem and authenticate method etc..

Something else that made this Sinatra application project easy to get started is the Corneal gem that creates all the files and folders you need to get started, it would've been much more difficult without this gem. At the moment I am content with the useability of my app, the flash messages I added to interact with the user if they enter incorrect log in/sign up credentials or try to upload something that can't at the moment be uploaded. I'm also content with how I approached how photos are displayed in the community uploads page as well as the individual users page which displays all photos that they have uploaded, I think the feel and aesthetic are very user friendly and hope to develop this app more throughout the course to add user funtionality like the ability to comment on other peoples art, DM other users, friend other users, upload many different media types and create an artist collaborative social media app.

I'm very excited for the next module in the program. The more and more advanced topics we discuss the more ideas I have, and coming from an art/media backgroud the creative possibilities really fuel my passion for coding and I really hope to implement my current background with the skills I'm developing here at Flatiron to develop applications I'm passionate about and create an impressive developer portfolio.
